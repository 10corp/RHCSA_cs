# Why this notes

Times ago some of my friends began to tell me to start the Red Hat Certification Program[^010-1], I'm not a SysAdmin (I came from Engineering in Computer Science and I want to become a UX guy) but I know Linux and its power, I started to use it when I was 14 and now I'm 26, so I googled about it.
  
The Red Hat Certification Program are IT Professional certifications for Red Hat products and general Linux related skills such as system administration on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, all certifications are given after passing exams. The program distinguishes itself in that the exams are performance-based, meaning that students must perform tasks on a live system, rather than answering multiple choice questions.  

RHCSA[^010-2] is the entry-level certification that focuses on actual competencies at system administration, including installation and configuration of a Red Hat Linux system and attaching it to a live network running network services.
To achieve the RHCSA certification the student must pass EX200, a half-day hands-on lab exam. The minimum passing score for the exam is 210 out of 300 possible points (70%). There is no prerequisite for the exam, but Red Hat recommends preparing for the exam by taking courses in Red Hat System Administration (RH124 or RH135) if one does not have previous experience.
RHCSA was launched in 2002 as Red Hat Certified Technician (RHCT). As of July 2009 there were 30,000 RHCTs. In November 2010 it was renamed to RHCSA.

I googled also about some notes, Cheat sheet or books but except some valid books[^010-3] these is nothing that I can't consult on my eBook's reader or that I can share with my friends, so I started to write a collaborative notes on GitHub.

## Some details

As I said I'm not a SysAdmin but I'm simple Linux passionate, I wrote (and I'm writing) this ebook not for money but following my passion, my knowledge and the "Exam objectives" so, for sure, you can find some mistakes or something wrong, please send me a mail or update the notes.
